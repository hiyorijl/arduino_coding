# arduino_coding

## What's this?
Code I did while learning Arduino in the intro 3 weeks Arduino course ['Arduino y algunas aplicaciones'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/arduino-aplicaciones) de la UNAM. plus the materials and schematics to complete it. Repository's main purpose is to recording my learning experience with Arduino.

There's **2 projects** on here:
1. Prototype of LED lights designed as arrow shapes for byciclist for safe transportation purposes.
2. An automatic pill dispenser that uses a motor to control the pill positions with an alarm with sound and lights.

## Materials

The materials required can be found on [this document for materials](https://github.com/hiyorijl/coursera-arduino/blob/main/%F0%9F%9B%A0%EF%B8%8F%20materials%20and%20needed%20stuff/(spanish)%20material%20list%20%2C%20lista%20de%20materiales.pdf), in my country the 2 projects has costed $128 dollars for reference. you also will need to send to a professional that knows how to cut MDF with lasers and knows AutoCAD to make the pill dispenser, I asked an architecture student and they know locations on where to find them or search on Google (maps) *laser cutting services*.

## Learning and knowledge prerequired.
The document for materials and the whole course on Coursera is on Spanish. On the software side the project *can* be completed with C++ beginner-intermediate experience and the hardware part can be completed if you can actually read schematic diagrams beforehand (or not i wouldn't know lmaooo).

- **For further learning later**

### Environment
The whole course is just **2 examples** used as intro projects for Arduino since the projects is just **C++** code with **Arduino libraries** using the Arduino IDE (`choco install arduino` on Windows); the necessary frameworks come with the IDE. I don't have experience with other IDEs or envs for making Arduino hardware / framework work *yet* but some might be interested on [PlatformIO IDE for VSCode](https://github.com/platformio/platformio-vscode-ide).

## Schematics for IO pin numbers on Arduino UNO
This code is originally used for an Arduino UNO with the following schematic diagram for the IO-pin-numbers [![Armado-del-prototipo-de-chaleco-para-ciclistas-2023-06-03.png](https://i.postimg.cc/26Qkj8BZ/Armado-del-prototipo-de-chaleco-para-ciclistas-2023-06-03.png)](https://postimg.cc/Q9MG0Dm8)
